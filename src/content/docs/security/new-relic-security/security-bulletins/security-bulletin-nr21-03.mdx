## Action items [#action]

To remediate this vulnerability in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers take one of the following actions immediately:

1. Upgrade your Java Agent to either version [6.5.2](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes/java-agent-651/) or [7.4.2](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes/java-agent-741/). These agent versions have been updated to use the remediated 2.15.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework.

System Requirement: Java 8 or higher. If you are on Java 7 or earlier and unable to update to Java 8, please use the following workaround.

OR

2. [Apache has published workaround options](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html), one of which we recommend for customers that are unable to update their version of log4j at this time.

This step will remediate your New Relic Java agent only. Customers that are using affected versions of the log4j framework (versions 2.10 to 2.14.1) directly in their applications will also need to either upgrade log4j to version 2.15.0 or use the published workaround to remediate this issue for their application.

You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to [NR21-04](/docs/security/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr21-04) for more information.

## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. We have updated the New Relic Java agent to use a remediated version 2.15.0 of the Apache log4j 2 logging framework. Due to the vulnerability in the log4j logging framework in versions 2.0 to 2.14.1 customers are encouraged to immediately update their agent versions to either 6.5.1 or 7.4.1.

Separately, customers that are using affected versions of the log4j framework (versions 2.0 to 2.14.1) directly in their applications are also encouraged to upgrade log4j to 2.15.0 to remediate this issue for their application.

Upgrading your New Relic Java agent will not remediate this issue for your application itself, if you use affected versions of log4j.
